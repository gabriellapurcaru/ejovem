<td><h6> To know Fortaleza, Ceará's capital city, is also to go on a trip on its history. The city was modernized, but still keeps signs from the past in its churches, fortresses, squares, stations, theaters, historic buildings and, naturally, in its museums. The city center is filled with memories: the Fortress of Nossa Senhora da Assunção, built on construction in classical style from the end of the 18th century, which used to be the State Government headquarters.</h6></td>

To talk along Beira Mar Avenue from its beginning, in Mucuripe, up to its very end the English's Brigde, at Iracema Beach, is a must do walk, and quite reinvigorating. Boat trips along the coast are offered at tourist spots and are ideal to enjoy a panoramic view of the capital from a different perspective.
