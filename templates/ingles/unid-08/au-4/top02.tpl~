<p><b>Mario’s week</b></p>
<p>I have a very normal life. In the morning, I need to go to school. In the afternoon, after lunch, I have to do my homework and exercise in the gym. At night, I have to help my mother with the baby and organize my clothes and material for school the next day. I like to swim in the lake. I don’t like soccer. At school, I like to talk and listen to music with my friends. I want to be a professional dj in the future. It is my dream! I need to make it happen. I want to finish High School and go to University. To do this, I need to study hard and pass vestibular. I also want to travel to many places in the world, so I need to study English and Spanish. Languages are very important! I also need to get a job now to get some money to live! By the way, my name is Lucas and I am 18 years old.
