<p><b>Leo’s weekend</b></p>
<p>Leo is 23 years old. He is a University student but he also works as a store clerk. He doesn’t have much free time during the week, but he really has fun on the weekend. He loves sports, especially surfing and swimming, so he always goes to the beach on Saturday mornings to swim or surf. Sometimes, his girlfriend, Susie, goes with him. In the afternoon, Leo relaxes. He usually sleeps for one or two hours. On Saturday evenings, Leo goes out with his girlfriend and their friends. He loves to dance. They usually go to a party or to a dance club. On Saturdays, Leo goes to bed at 2 or 3 a.m. On Sundays, Leo wakes up late, at around 11:30a.m. He usually has a big breakfast and then he goes to the beach again. In the evening, he sometimes has dinner with his mother, or sees his girlfriend, Susie. He doesn’t go to bed late on Sunday, because he has to wake up at 6:00 a.m. on Monday.
