<p>My name is Gabriela, and I’m 18 years old. My father is a bus driver and my mother is a maid. I’m in High School and I’m studying for the entrance exam at the University (vestibular). I want to go to the University because I want be an English teacher.</p>
<p>Family is important to me, and I want to get married and to have children, to live in a nice house, and to have a car. I would like to have enough money in the future to have a decent life with my family.</p>
<p>For the next year, I have three goals: I will take the University entrance exam, I will get a part-time job and I will study English. I don’t want to do what my Mom does, so I need to study hard and get a good job.</p>
